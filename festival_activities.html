						Traditionally, the Highland Games revolved around athletic and sports competitions. The games
						were also a way for clans to showcase their relative strength without actually having to go to
						war. Some of the implements used in the games were created as alternatives to traditional
						weapons when England forbid any Scotsman from bearing arms. Though other activities were always
						a part of the festivities, many today still consider Highland athletics to be what the games are
						all about in short, that the athletics are the Games, and all the other activities are just
						entertainment.</div>
